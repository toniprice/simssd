# multilevel<br/>sample size<br/>determination<span class="sub-head"> <span class="chevron">>>></span> at speed</span>

<br/>
The `simssd` R package uses simulation to do
[sample size determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination)
(SSD), the process of estimating the sample size needed for
a statistical study, and
[power computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test)
for fixed effects in
[multilevel linear regression models](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/multilevel-models/).
It has a focus on improving computational speed.

## Installation

<div class="note">
<span class="note-emph"><span class="note-head">Please note:</span>
`simssd` is currently under construction.</span> The
[source code](https://github.com/toniprice/simssd/) and
[documentation](./reference/index.html)
are placeholders as they have not yet been published.
Installation instructions to follow at a later date.

Meanwhile, see the [Introduction to simssd](./articles/intro.html).

## Historical Context

The predecessor to `simssd` was developed to support my PhD research,
<!-- TODO: Restore the EThOS link when EThOS is back online -->
<!-- [A faster simulation approach to sample size determination for random effect models](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&uin=uk.bl.ethos.730872), -->
[A faster simulation approach to sample size determination for random effect models](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1052823916),
at the
[Centre for Multilevel Modelling](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/)
(University of Bristol).

It extended ideas arising from the
[MLPowSim](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlpowsim/)
software written by William Browne and Mousa Golalizadeh.

## Acknowledgements

I gratefully acknowledge funding provided for my PhD via
[UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/)
grant number ES/H044094/1.

My thanks to the late
[Professor Jon Rasbash](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/team/rasbash.html){.people-link}
for getting the original project off the ground as well as
[Professor William Browne](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/william-j-browne){.people-link},
[Professor Fiona Steele, CBE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Professor-Fiona-Steele){.people-link},
[Professor Debora Price](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/debora.price){.people-link}
and the late
[Professor Harvey Goldstein](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/team/hg/){.people-link}
for their invaluable guidance and support.

The [MLPowSim manual](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmm/migrated/documents/mlpowsim-manual.pdf)
by William Browne, Mousa Golalizadeh and Richard Parker
contains a number of motivating examples.

The software design of `simssd` draws on some ideas from:<br/>
Chalmers RP, and Adkins, MC (2020). "Writing effective and reliable Monte Carlo
simulations with the SimDesign package." The Quantitative Methods for
Psychology, 16(4), 248â€“280.
[doi:10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.16.4.p248).

In an ongoing way, tools provided by
[Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/){.people-link}
and his colleagues at
[Posit Software, PBC](https://posit.co/)
(formerly RStudio, PBC) enable me to develop much higher quality software in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/)
than I otherwise would have been able to.
Thank you Hadley &amp; others at Posit &#160;
